<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Bing Wallpaper

This projcet is one of my oldest hobies. It downloads bing image everyday and stores it in a folder which you can make a slideshow with it in your windows theme settings. After a short period you're going to have an amazing wallpaper slideshow that never bores you.



### Built With

The project originally was written by .NET Framework. I tried to migrate to .NET 7 as a playground and have some fun with it which turned out supoer fun.


* .NET 7
* SQLite
* MaterialUI
* NLog
* Inno Setup
